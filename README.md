# 🦸‍♀️ Code Batman Tracker

A dynamic dashboard to track high-impact open source contributions with superhero style.

## Overview

Code Batman is my approach to open source contribution: quick, high-impact technical fixes that help projects without requiring long-term maintenance commitment. Like Batman swooping in to save Gotham, I identify specific technical challenges in open source projects and deliver clean, well-tested solutions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Contribution Cards**: Displays each contribution with detailed metadata
- **Real-time Stats**: Skills used, impact distribution, and tools arsenal
- **GitHub Integration**: Direct links to pull requests and issues
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices with Batman-themed styling
- **Easy Maintenance**: JSON-based data structure for simple updates

└── about/                    # About and methodology pages
```

## Data Structure

Each contribution is tracked with:

- **Basic Info**: Title, description, organization, dates
- **Technical Details**: Skills used, tools leveraged, challenges solved
- **Impact Metrics**: High/medium/low impact rating
- **Proof Links**: GitHub PRs, issues, forks
- **Learning Outcomes**: Insights and knowledge gained

## Adding New Contributions

1. Update `data/contributions.json` with new contribution data
2. Update metadata counters (totalContributions, totalOrganizations)
3. Deploy to update the live site

## Example Contribution Entry

```json
{
  "id": "unique-contribution-id",
  "organization": "Organization Name",
  "project": "Project Name", 
  "title": "What you implemented",
  "description": "Brief description of the work",
  "status": "submitted|merged|rejected",
  "technicalSkillsUsed": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2"],
  "toolsLeveraged": ["Tool 1", "Tool 2"],
  "proofLinks": [
    {
      "type": "pull-request",
      "url": "https://github.com/...",
      "description": "Link description"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

To run locally:

1. Serve the files with a local server (due to CORS for JSON loading)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Edit `data/contributions.json` to add new contributions

## Deployment

Ready for deployment to Netlify, Vercel, or any static site host.

## The Code Batman Philosophy

- **Quick Impact**: Focus on discrete, well-scoped technical improvements
- **Clean Implementation**: Deliver production-ready code with proper testing  
- **No Ongoing Ownership**: Complete the mission and move on
- **Learning Focus**: Each mission teaches new tools and techniques
